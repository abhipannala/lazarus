Back from the dead! I was pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics, it was the usual grad school stuff. Stress out, average 5 hours of sleep per night, tackle impossible course loads, write last minute papers, crush industry projects and win some competitions and awards on the way to graduation!

After all that, I tell myself the same thing I told myself after my undergrad - "NEVER AGAIN". But I might go back eventually :)

Haven't used git in a long time, need to run some trials. As you can see, I am not afraid to put my stupidity on display! 

No matter, more opportunities to learn!
