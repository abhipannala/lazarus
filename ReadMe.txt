Back from the dead! I was pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics, it was the usual grad school stuff. Stress out, average 5 hours of sleep per night, 
tackle impossible course loads, write papers in the last minute, crush the industry projects and win some competitions and awards on the way to graduation!

After all that, I will tell myself the same thing I told myself after my undergrad - "NEVER AGAIN". But I might go back eventually :)

Haven't used git in so long, need to run some trials. As you can see, I am not afraid to put my stupidity on display! 
No matter, more opportunities to learn!
